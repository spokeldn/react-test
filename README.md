Thanks for your time working on the tech test for Spoke!

The data for you to work on can be found at [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/spokeldn/react-test/db]

We'd like to see 3 pages:

Category page:
* Lists all products in given category
* Highlights the new products
* Has filtering functionality for the products
* Goes to the product page when clicked on a product

Product page:
* Renders the given image link by adding the product name (please have a look at the the page [https://dummyimage.com/])
* Shows the product price
* Shows the description until `eirmod` with 3 dots. when clicked shows the full description. Please think of a UX solution for making it obvious for the user
* Adds the product to cart
* If the product is not available (ie after adding max amount of products) please show `Stock not available`

Cart page:
* Lists the products that are added to the cart
* Has delete from cart functionality
* Shows the total with a dummy `Pay` button

BONUS:
* Update the item amount in the cart (think about stock)
* Add a promotion input to make %20 discount
* Responsive design for product page for mobile (any kind of design based on your discretion)

Please use React.js and a state management library (ie. Redux) of your preference. Please write relevant tests preferably using Jest or Enzyme.

Pixel perfect styling is not important however please make it look similar to the designs in this repo.

Happy hacking!
